Note: Follows the java floating point format. So integers are not accepted as floats (i.e. 1 will not be accepted but 1f will be accepted). 
      Signs at the front of the number will also not be accepted as those are unary operators (i.e. -1.0 and +1.0 will not be accepted)
      The float type suffix 'd' and 'D' are valid but will be treated for floats and not doubles. 
      
      Included is a picture of a rough sketch of my DFA. Keep in mind that it is a very rough sketch, so it may not account for all possible inputs/cases.
      I used this DFA to help get a sense of what inputs are expected for the program and in what order the inputs should be in. 
      I made sure to account for almost every possible inputs/cases that I may not have illustrated in the picture in my final program.
