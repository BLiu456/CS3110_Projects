Note: Follows the java floating point format. So integers are not accepted as floats (i.e. 1 will not be accepted but 1f will be accepted). 
      Signs at the front of the number will also not be accepted as those are unary operators (i.e. -1.0 and +1.0 will not be accepted)
      The float type suffix 'd' and 'D' are valid but will be treated for floats and not doubles.
